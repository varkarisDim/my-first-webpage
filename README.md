# my-first-webpage
This is my very first webpage, created on March 2021 as a personal project to serve as an introduction to web development, combining JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

It features a drawing canvas.

There is also a very basic implementation of the webpack bundler.

## Instructions

Node.js and npm is required to run the project on a local dev server.

See: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

#### In a command prompt, opened in the repository root folder, run:

1. npm install
1. npm start


* The webpage is served at localhost:8080.
* To stop the server use CTRL+C with the command prompt focused.
